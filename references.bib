	abstract = {Responding to stimuli as same and different can be considered a critical component of a variety of language and academic repertoires. Whereas responding to “sameness” and generalized identity matching (i.e., coordination) have been studied extensively, there appears to be a significant gap in behavior analytic research and educational programs with regard to nonmatching relations or relations of difference. We review research on difference relations from a variety of domains, including comparative psychology, as well as experimental, and translational behavior analysis. We examine a range of studies, including research on the perception of difference and oddity responding, as well as investigations on establishing relational frames of distinction. We present suggestions for future research and describe potential methods for teaching skills related to relations of difference.},

For laws containing a location and a scale parameter a form with a somewhat restricted type of invariance is found even when the law is not everywhere differentiable with regard to the parameters. This form has the properties required to give a general rule for stating the prior probability in a large class of estimation problems.},

As many charts do not explicitly include trend lines or related statistical summaries, viewers often visually estimate trends directly from a plot. How reliable are the inferences viewers draw when performing such regression by eye? Do particular visualization designs or data features bias trend perception? We present a series of crowdsourced experiments that assess the accuracy of trends estimated using regression by eye across a variety of bivariate visualizations, and examine potential sources of bias in these estimations. We ﬁnd that viewers accurately estimate trends in many standard visualizations of bivariate data, but that both visual features (e.g., “within-thebar” bias) and data features (e.g., the presence of outliers) can result in visual estimates that systematically diverge from standard least-squares regression models.},

In this study two experiments dealt with the effects of the statistical training of the viewer and various characteristics of the display on estimates. Statistical knowledge was related to higher estimates of correlations and the use of a wider range of values, but people with and without statistical knowledge were equally affected by the type of dispersion of the point cloud, the mere display of the regression line, and the slope of the regression line. Results indicate that estimates of correlations from scatterplots are partly based on perceptual processes that are influenced by visual properties of the display and are unrelated to the cognitive structures created by formal statistical training.},

Our technique varies from previous approaches in that new datasets are iteratively generated from a seed dataset through random perturbations of individual data points, and can be directed towards a desired outcome through a simulated annealing optimization strategy. Our method has the benefit of being agnostic to the particular statistical properties that are to remain constant between the datasets, and allows for control over the graphical appearance of resulting output.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems}, pages = {1290–1294}, numpages = {5}, keywords = {anscombe, visualization, scatter plots}, location = {Denver, Colorado, USA}, series = {CHI '17} }
